#+title: brainstorm document for code structure

* Types
NOTE:
- all types min only for now, return error when max
- code should be type-agnostic modulo missing functions in OSCAR

** TropicalPlueckerVector{minOrMax}
Parameters:
- minOrMax distinguishes between min and max convention
Content:
- Vector{Vector{Int}}: pluecker vector indices
- Vector{TropicalSemiringElem{minOrMax}}: pluecker vector coordinates

** DualCell{cellType,minOrMax}
Parameters:
- cellType distinguishes between (Question: is this necessary?)
  . tropical hypersurfaces
  . tropical linear spaces
  . inverted linear spaces
- minOrMax distinguishes between min and max convention
Content:
- ambient support (from hypersurface, linear space, inverted linear space)
- active support

** MixedCell{minOrMax}
Parameters:
- minOrMax distinguishes between min and max convention
Content:
- Vector{DualCell}: dual cells of complementary dimension

** DualHeightPath{pathType,minOrMax}
Parameters:
- pathType distinguishes between
  . straight line
  . bent line (potentially for paths in the Dressian)
- minOrMax distinguishes between min and max convention
Content: depends on type
Must-have feature:
- Given dual cell and path, time until flip and direction of flip
Note:
deterministic tiebreaker needs to be baked in to ensure consistency amongst paths


** DualCellTracker{minOrMax}
Parameters:
- minOrMax distinguishes between min and max convention
Content:
- DualCell
- DualHeightPath
- time of next flip (for optimisation purposes)
- facet to flip over

** MixedCellTracker{minOrMax} = vertex of our mixed cell tree
Parameters:
- minOrMax distinguishes between min and max convention
Content:
- Vector{DualCellTracker}

* Functions

** total_degree_starting_data(::TropicalLinearSpace,::Vector{TropicalHypersurfaces}; perturb_generically::Bool=false)
Input: self-explanatory
- if perturb_generically==true, do a generic perturbation to ensure transverse intersection
Output:
- Vector{MixedCell}: starting mixed cells
- DualHeightPath

** dual_cell_flip
Input:
- DualCellTracker
Output:
- Vector{DualCellTracker} with higher time until next flip

** mixed_cell_flip
Input:
- MixedCellTracker (= vertex in mixed cell tree)
Output:
- Vector{MixedCellTracker} (= children in the mixed cell tree)
Note:
- merely calls dual_cell_flip


* Deprecated

** MixedHeightPath{minOrMax} (unnecessary)
Parameters:
- minOrMax distinguishes between min and max convention
Content:
- Vector{DualHeightPath}: dual height paths of complementary dimension
