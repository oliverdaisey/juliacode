#+title: brainstorm document for code structure

* Types
NOTE:
- all types min only for now, return error when max
- code should be type-agnostic modulo missing functions in OSCAR

** TropicalPlueckerVector{minOrMax}
Parameters:
- minOrMax distinguishes between min and max convention
Content:
- Vector{Vector{Int}}: pluecker vector indices
- Vector{TropicalSemiringElem{minOrMax}}: pluecker vector coordinates

** DualCell{cellType,minOrMax}
Parameters:
- cellType distinguishes between (Question: is this necessary?)
  . tropical hypersurfaces
  . tropical linear spaces
  . inverted linear spaces
- minOrMax distinguishes between min and max convention
Content:
- ambient support (from hypersurface, linear space, inverted linear space)
- active support

** MixedCell{minOrMax}
Parameters:
- minOrMax distinguishes between min and max convention
Content:
- Vector{DualCell}: dual cells of complementary dimension

** DualPath{pathType,minOrMax}
all paths are assumed to consists of line segments and linear between nodes
Must-have features:
- next node(s) (given current time)
- current direction (given current time)
Content:
- Vector{Vector{TropicalSemiringElem}} - a sequence of nodes between which it is assumed to be linear
- tiebreaker
Note:
deterministic tiebreaker needs to be baked in to ensure consistency amongst paths

** MixedPath{minOrMax}
Parameters:
- minOrMax distinguishes between min and max convention
Content:
- Vector{Vector{TropicalSemiringElem}} - a sqeuence of nodes between which the path is linear
- Vector{tiebreaker}
Note:
- merged together from individual DualPaths
- remove nodes as they are crossed

** MixedCellTracker{minOrMax} = vertex of our mixed cell tree
Parameters:
- minOrMax distinguishes between min and max convention
Content:
- MixedCell
- MixedPath

* Functions

** total_degree_starting_data(::TropicalLinearSpace,::Vector{TropicalHypersurfaces}; perturb_generically::Bool=false)
Input: self-explanatory
- if perturb_generically==true, do a generic perturbation to ensure transverse intersection
Output:
- Vector{MixedCell}: starting mixed cells
- DualPath

** dual_cell_flip
Input:
- DualCellTracker
Output:
- Vector{DualCellTracker} with higher time until next flip

** mixed_cell_flip
Input:
- MixedCellTracker (= vertex in mixed cell tree)
Output:
- Vector{MixedCellTracker} (= children in the mixed cell tree)
Note:
- merely calls dual_cell_flip


* Todo

1. in dual_cell constructors:
   - remove pluecker_vector from constructors and input check
2. implement DualCellTracker (= DualCell + vector of nodes)
3. implement MixedCellTracker constructor from a vector of DualCellTrackers (series and parallel; nodes in MixedCellTracker = product of nodes of DualCellTrackers)
4. implement perturbation for MixedCellTracker (always perturbs next node)



* Deprecated

** DualCellTracker{minOrMax}
Parameters:
- minOrMax distinguishes between min and max convention
Content:
- DualCell
- DualPath
- time of next flip (for optimisation purposes)
- facet to flip over
