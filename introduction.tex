\section{Introduction}

In \cite{Jensen2016arXiv}, Jensen develops a tropical analogue of homotopy continuation to compute the stable intersection of $n$ tropical hypersurfaces in $\RR^n$.  Jensen's main motivation was the computation of mixed volumes and applications to polyhedral homotopies \cite{HuberSturmfels1995}.  The algorithm was initially implemented in \textsc{gfan} \cite{gfan,Jensen2016ICMS}, where it is still powering the mixed volume computation to date.  Since then, polynomial system solvers like \textsc{HomotopyContinuation.jl} \cite{HomotopyContinuation.jl} have picked up the algorithms and are using it for polyhedral homotopies.

In this article, we will generalize Jensen's tropical homotopies to computing the stable intersection of $k$ tropical hypersurfaces and a tropical linear space of dimension $n-k$ in $\RR^n$.  Similar to Jensen, our motivation also comes from polynomial system solving.
