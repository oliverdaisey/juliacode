# TropicalHomotopies.jl
ðŸš€ A Julia package for tropical homotopy continuation on a wide range of tropical spaces, utilising OSCAR for much of its functionality. Features include fast computations of intersections of tropical hypersurfaces, tropical linear spaces, and inverted tropical linear spaces.

This is a WIP package. 

## Installation
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("TropicalHomotopies")
```
Built on the work of Anders Jensen at https://arxiv.org/abs/1601.02818
